			Chuck Norris is an American actor and martial artist who rose to fame in the 1970s and 1980s with his roles in a number of action films. He was born Carlos Ray Norris on March 10, 1940, in Ryan, Oklahoma, and grew up in Torrance, California. Norris began his martial arts training at the age of six, and by the time he was in his 20s, he had earned a black belt in Tang Soo Do, a Korean martial art. He later became the first Westerner to be promoted to an 8th degree black belt in Taekwondo.

			In the late 1960s and early 1970s, Norris made a name for himself as a martial arts instructor, and he opened several karate schools in the United States. He also began competing in martial arts tournaments and became a five-time undefeated World Middleweight Karate Champion.
